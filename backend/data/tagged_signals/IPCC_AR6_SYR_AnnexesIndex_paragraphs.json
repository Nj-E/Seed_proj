A more comprehensive, harmonised set of deﬁnitions for terms used in this SYR and the three AR6 Working Group reports is available from the IPCC Online Glossary: https://apps.ipcc.ch/glossary/ Readers are requested to refer to this comprehensive online glossary for deﬁnitions of terms of a more technical nature, and for scientiﬁc references relevant to individual terms. Italicized words indicate that the term is deﬁned in this or/and the online glossary. Subterms appear in italics beneath main terms. 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development A UN resolution in September 2015 aadopting a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity in a new global development framework anchored in 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Abrupt climate change A large-scale abrupt change in the climate system that takes place over a few decades or less, persists (or is anticipated to persist) for at least a few decades and causes substantial impacts in human and/or natural systems. See also: Abrupt change, Tipping point. Adaptation In human systems, the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneﬁcial opportunities. In natural systems, the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects. See also: Adaptation options, Adaptive capacity, Maladaptive actions (Maladaptation). Adaptation gap The difference between actually implemented adaptation and a societally set goal, determined largely by preferences related to tolerated climate change impacts and reﬂecting resource limitations and competing priorities. Adaptation limits The point at which an actor’s objectives (or system needs) cannot be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions. • Hard adaptation limit - No adaptive actions are possible to avoid intolerable risks. • Soft adaptation limit - Options may exist but are currently not available to avoid intolerable risks through adaptive action. Transformational adaptation Adaptation that changes the fundamental attributes of a social-ecological system in anticipation of climate change and its impacts. Aerosol A suspension of airborne solid or liquid particles, with typical particle size in the range of a few nanometres to several tens of micrometres and atmospheric lifetimes of up to several days in the troposphere and up to years in the stratosphere. The term aerosol, which includes both the particles and the suspending gas, is often used in this report in its plural form to mean ‘aerosol particles’. Aerosols may be of either natural or anthropogenic origin in the troposphere; stratospheric aerosols mostly stem from volcanic eruptions. Aerosols can cause an effective radiative forcing directly through scattering and absorbing radiation (aerosol–radiation interaction), and indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nucleating particles that affect the properties of clouds (aerosol–cloud interaction), and upon deposition on snow- or ice-covered surfaces. Atmospheric aerosols may be either emitted as primary particulate matter or formed within the atmosphere from gaseous precursors (secondary production). Aerosols may be composed of sea salt, organic carbon, black carbon",

Anthropogenic Resulting from or produced by human activities. Behavioural change In this report, behavioural change refers to alteration of human decisions and actions in ways that mitigate climate change and/or reduce negative consequences of climate change impacts. Biodiversity Biodiversity or biological diversity means the variability among living organisms from all sources including, among other things, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems. See also: Ecosystem, Ecosystem services. Bioenergy Energy derived from any form of biomass or its metabolic by-products. See also: Biofuel. Bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS) Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology applied to a bioenergy facility. Note that, depending on the total emissions of the BECCS supply chain, carbon dioxide (CO2) can be removed from the atmosphere. See also: Anthropogenic removals, Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), Carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Blue carbon Biologically-driven carbon ﬂuxes and storage in marine systems that are amenable to management. Coastal blue carbon focuses on rooted vegetation in the coastal zone, such as tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrasses. These ecosystems have high carbon burial rates on a per unit area basis and accumulate carbon in their soils and sediments. They provide many non-climatic benefits and can contribute to ecosystem-based adaptation. If degraded or lost, coastal blue carbon ecosystems are likely to release most of their carbon back to the atmosphere. There is current debate regarding the application of the blue carbon concept to other coastal and non-coastal processes and ecosystems, including the open ocean. See also: Ecosystem services, Sequestration. Blue infrastructure See: Infrastructure. Carbon budget Refers to two concepts in the literature: (1) an assessment of carbon cycle sources and sinks on a global level, through the synthesis of evidence for fossil fuel and cement emissions, emissions and removals associated with land use and land-use change, ocean and natural land sources and sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2), and the resulting change in atmospheric CO2 concentration. This is referred to as the Global Carbon Budget; (2) the maximum amount of cumulative net global anthropogenic CO2 emissions that would result in limiting global warming to a given level with a given probability, taking into account the effect of other anthropogenic climate forcers. This is referred to as the Total Carbon Budget when expressed starting from the pre-industrial period, and as the Remaining Carbon Budget when expressed from a recent speciﬁed date. [Note 1: Net anthropogenic CO2 emissions are anthropogenic CO2 emissions minus anthropogenic CO2 removals. See also: Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR). Note 2: The maximum amount of cumulative net global anthropogenic CO2 emissions is reached at the time that annual net anthropogenic CO2 emissions reach zero. Note 3: The degree to which anthropogenic climate forcers other than CO2 affect the total carbon budget and remaining carbon budget depends on human choices about the extent to which these forcers are",

    "text": "122 Annex I Annexes Meteorological Organization (WMO). The relevant quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. Climate change A change in the state of the climate that can be identiﬁed (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. See also: Climate variability, Detection and attribution, Global warming, Natural (climate) variability, Ocean acidiﬁcation (OA). [Note that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, deﬁnes climate change as: ‘a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods’. The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition and climate variability attributable to natural causes.] Climate extreme (extreme weather or climate event) The occurrence of a value of a weather or climate variable above (or below) a threshold value near the upper (or lower) ends of the range of observed values of the variable. By deﬁnition, the characteristics of what is called extreme weather may vary from place to place in an absolute sense. When a pattern of extreme weather persists for some time, such as a season, it may be classiﬁed as an extreme climate event, especially if it yields an average or total that is itself extreme (e.g., high temperature, drought, or heavy rainfall over a season). For simplicity, both extreme weather events and extreme climate events are referred to collectively as ‘climate extremes’. Climate ﬁnance There is no agreed deﬁnition of climate ﬁnance. The term ‘climate ﬁnance’ is applied to the ﬁnancial resources devoted to addressing climate change by all public and private actors from global to local scales, including international ﬁnancial ﬂows to developing countries to assist them in addressing climate change. Climate ﬁnance aims to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions and/or to enhance adaptation and increase resilience to the impacts of current and projected climate change. Finance can come from private and public sources, channelled by various intermediaries, and is delivered by a range of instruments, including grants, concessional and non-concessional debt, and internal budget reallocations. Climate governance The structures, processes, and actions through which private and public actors seek to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Climate justice See: Justice. Climate literacy Climate literacy encompasses being aware of climate change, its anthropogenic causes, and implications. Climate resilient development (CRD) Climate-resilient development refers to the process of implementing greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation measures to support sustainable development for all.

In addition, parties may use other metrics to report supplemental information on aggregate emissions and removals of GHGs.] Compound weather/climate events The terms ‘compound events’, ‘compound extremes’ and ‘compound extreme events’ are used interchangeably in the literature and this report, and refer to the combination of multiple drivers and/or hazards that contribute to societal and/or environmental risk. Deforestation Conversion of forest to non-forest. See also: Afforestation, Reforestation, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). [Note: For a discussion of the term forest and related terms such as afforestation, reforestation and deforestation, see the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and their 2019 Refinement, and information provided by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] Demand-side measures Policies and programmes for inﬂuencing the demand for goods and/ or services. In the energy sector, demand-side mitigation measures aim at reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions emitted per unit of energy service used. Developed / developing countries (Industrialissed / developed / developing countries) There is a diversity of approaches for categorizing countries on the basis of their level of development, and for deﬁning terms such as industrialised, developed, or developing. Several categorisations are used in this report. (1) In the United Nations (UN) system, there is no established convention for the designation of developed and developing countries or areas. (2) The UN Statistics Division speciﬁes developed and developing regions based on common practice. In addition, speciﬁc countries are designated as least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, Small Island Developing States (SIDS), and transition economies. Many countries appear in more than one of these categories. (3) The World Bank uses income as the main criterion for classifying countries as low, lower middle, upper middle, and high income. (4) The UN Development Programme (UNDP) aggregates indicators for life expectancy, educational attainment, and income into a single composite Human Development Index (HDI) to classify countries as low, medium, high, or very high human development. Development pathways See: Pathways. Disaster risk management (DRM) Processes for designing, implementing and evaluating strategies, policies and measures to improve the understanding of current and future disaster risk, foster disaster risk reduction and transfer, and promote continuous improvement in disaster preparedness, prevention and protection, response and recovery practices, with the explicit purpose of increasing human security, well-being, quality of life and sustainable development (SD). Displacement (of humans) The involuntary movement, individually or collectively, of persons from their country or community, notably for reasons of armed conﬂict, civil unrest, or natural or human-made disasters. Drought An exceptional period of water shortage for existing ecosystems and the human population (due to low rainfall, high temperature and/or wind). See also: Plant evaporative stress. Agricultural and ecological drought Depending on the affected biome: a period with abnormal soil moisture deﬁcit, which results from combined shortage of precipitation and excess evapotranspiration, and during the growing season impinges on crop production or ecosystem function in general.

Enabling conditions (for adaptation and mitigation options) Conditions that enhance the feasibility of adaptation and mitigation options. Enabling conditions include ﬁnance, technological innovation, strengthening policy instruments, institutional capacity, multi-level governance, and changes in human behaviour and lifestyles. Equality A principle that ascribes equal worth to all human beings, including equal opportunities, rights and obligations, irrespective of origins. See also: Equity, Fairness. Inequality Uneven opportunities and social positions, and processes of discrimination within a group or society, based on gender, class, ethnicity, age, and (dis)ability, often produced by uneven development. Income inequality refers to gaps between highest and lowest income earners within a country and between countries. Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) See: Climate sensitivity. Equity The principle of being fair and impartial, and a basis for understanding how the impacts and responses to climate change, including costs and beneﬁts, are distributed in and by society in more or less equal ways. Often aligned with ideas of equality, fairness and justice and applied with respect to equity in the responsibility for, and distribution of, climate impacts and policies across society, generations, and gender, and in the sense of who participates and controls the processes of decision-making. Exposure The presence of people; livelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental functions, services, and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social, or cultural assets in places and settings that could be adversely affected. See also: Hazard, Exposure, Vulnerability, Impacts, Risk. Feasibility In this report, feasibility refers to the potential for a mitigation or adaptation option to be implemented. Factors inﬂuencing feasibility are context-dependent, temporally dynamic, and may vary between different groups and actors. Feasibility depends on geophysical, environmental-ecological, technological, economic, socio-cultural and institutional factors that enable or constrain the implementation of an option. The feasibility of options may change when different options are combined and increase when enabling conditions are strengthened. See also: Enabling conditions (for adaptation and mitigation options). Fire weather Weather conditions conducive to triggering and sustaining wildﬁres, usually based on a set of indicators and combinations of indicators including temperature, soil moisture, humidity, and wind. Fire weather does not include the presence or absence of fuel load. Food loss and waste The decrease in quantity or quality of food. Food waste is part of food loss and refers to discarding or alternative (non-food) use of food that is safe and nutritious for human consumption along the entire food supply chain, from primary production to end household consumer level. Food waste is recognized as a distinct part of food loss because the drivers that generate it and the solutions to it are different from those of food losses. Food security A situation that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufﬁcient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. The four pillars of food security are availability, access, utilization and stability.",

See also: Exposure, Vulnerability, Impacts, Risk. Impacts The consequences of realised risks on natural and human systems, where risks result from the interactions of climate-related hazards (including extreme weather/climate events), exposure, and vulnerability. Impacts generally refer to effects on lives, livelihoods, health and well- being, ecosystems and species, economic, social and cultural assets, services (including ecosystem services), and infrastructure. Impacts may be referred to as consequences or outcomes and can be adverse or beneﬁcial. See also: Adaptation, Hazard, Exposure, Vulnerability, Risk. Inequality See: Equality. Indigenous knowledge (IK) The understandings, skills and philosophies developed by societies with long histories of interaction with their natural surroundings. For many Indigenous Peoples, IK informs decision-making about fundamental aspects of life, from day-to-day activities to longer term actions. This knowledge is integral to cultural complexes, which also encompass language, systems of classiﬁcation, resource use practices, social interactions, values, ritual and spirituality. These distinctive ways of knowing are important facets of the world’s cultural diversity. See also: Local knowledge (LK). Indigenous Peoples Indigenous Peoples and nations are those that, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing on those territories, or parts of them. They form at present principally non-dominant sectors of society and are often determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions, and common law system. Informal settlement A term given to settlements or residential areas that by at least one criterion fall outside ofﬁcial rules and regulations. Most informal settlements have poor housing (with widespread use of temporary materials) and are developed on land that is occupied illegally with high levels of overcrowding. In most such settlements, provision for safe water, sanitation, drainage, paved roads, and basic services is inadequate or lacking. The term ‘slum’ is often used for informal settlements, although it is misleading as many informal settlements develop into good quality residential areas, especially where governments support such development. Infrastructure The designed and built set of physical systems and corresponding institutional arrangements that mediate between people, their communities, and the broader environment to provide services that support economic growth, health, quality of life, and safety. Blue infrastructure Blue infrastructure includes bodies of water, watercourses, ponds, lakes and storm drainage, that provide ecological and hydrological functions including evaporation, transpiration, drainage, inﬁltration, and temporary storage of runoff and discharge. Green infrastructure The strategically planned interconnected set of natural and constructed ecological systems, green spaces and other landscape features that can provide functions and services including air and water puriﬁcation, temperature management, ﬂoodwater management and coastal defence often with co-beneﬁts for people and biodiversity.

Since managed land may include carbon dioxide (CO2) removals not considered as ‘anthropogenic’ in some of the scientiﬁc literature assessed in this report (e.g., removals associated with CO2 fertilisation and N deposition), the land-related net GHG emission estimates from global models included in this report are not necessarily directly comparable with LULUCF estimates in National GHG Inventories (IPCC 2006, 2019). Least Developed Countries (LDCs) A list of countries designated by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC) as meeting three criteria: (1) a low income criterion below a certain threshold of gross national income per capita of between USD 750 and USD 900, (2) a human resource weakness based on indicators of health, education, adult literacy, and (3) an economic vulnerability weakness based on indicators on instability of agricultural production, instability of export of goods and services, economic importance of non-traditional activities, merchandise export concentration, and the handicap of economic smallness. Countries in this category are eligible for a number of programmes focused on assisting countries most in need. These privileges include certain beneﬁts under the articles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Livelihood The resources used and the activities undertaken in order for people to live. Livelihoods are usually determined by the entitlements and assets to which people have access. Such assets can be categorised as human, social, natural, physical or ﬁnancial. Local knowledge (LK) The understandings and skills developed by individuals and populations, speciﬁc to the places where they live. Local knowledge informs decision-making about fundamental aspects of life, from day-to-day activities to longer term actions. This knowledge is a key element of the social and cultural systems which inﬂuence observations of and responses to climate change; it also informs governance decisions. See also: Indigenous knowledge (IK). Lock-in A situation in which the future development of a system, including infrastructure, technologies, investments, institutions, and behavioural norms, is determined or constrained (‘locked in’) by historic developments. See also: Path dependence. Loss and Damage, and losses and damages Research has taken Loss and Damage (capitalised letters) to refer to political debate under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) following the establishment of the Warsaw Mechanism on Loss and Damage in 2013, which is to ‘address loss and damage associated with impacts of climate change, including extreme events and slow onset events, in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.’ Lowercase letters (losses and damages) have been taken to refer broadly to harm from (observed) impacts and (projected) risks and can be economic or non-economic. Low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes Outcomes/events whose probability of occurrence is low or not well known (as in the context of deep uncertainty) but whose potential impacts on society and ecosystems could be high.

The quantiﬁcation of net zero GHG emissions depends on the GHG emission metric chosen to compare emissions and removals of different gases, as well as the time horizon chosen for that metric. See also: Greenhouse gas neutrality, Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), Net zero CO2 emissions. [Note 1: Greenhouse gas neutrality and net zero GHG emissions are overlapping concepts. The concept of net zero GHG emissions can be applied at global or sub-global scales (e.g., regional, national and sub-national). At a global scale, the terms GHG neutrality and net zero GHG emissions are equivalent. At sub-global scales, net zero GHG emissions is generally applied to emissions and removals under direct control or territorial responsibility of the reporting entity, while GHG neutrality generally includes anthropogenic emissions and anthropogenic removals within and beyond the direct control or territorial responsibility of the reporting entity. Accounting rules speciﬁed by GHG programmes or schemes can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the quantiﬁcation of relevant emissions and removals. Note 2: Under the Paris Rulebook (Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraph 37), parties have agreed to use GWP100 values from the IPCC AR5 or GWP100 values from a subsequent IPCC Assessment Report to report aggregate emissions and removals of GHGs. In addition, parties may use other metrics to report supplemental information on aggregate emissions and removals of GHGs.] New Urban Agenda The New Urban Agenda was adopted at the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) in Quito, Ecuador, on 20 October 2016. It was endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly at its sixty-eighth plenary meeting of the seventy-ﬁrst session on 23 December 2016. Overshoot pathways See: Pathways. Pathways The temporal evolution of natural and/or human systems towards a future state. Pathway concepts range from sets of quantitative and qualitative scenarios or narratives of potential futures to solution-oriented decision-making processes to achieve desirable societal goals. Pathway approaches typically focus on biophysical, techno-economic and/or socio-behavioural trajectories and involve various dynamics, goals and actors across different scales. See also: Scenario, Storyline. Development pathways Development pathways evolve as the result of the countless decisions being made and actions being taken at all levels of societal structure, as well due to the emergent dynamics within and between institutions, cultural norms, technological systems and other drivers of behavioural change. See also: Shifting development pathways (SDPs), Shifting development pathways to sustainability (SDPS). Emission pathways Modelled trajectories of global anthropogenic emissions over the 21st century are termed emission pathways. Overshoot pathways Pathways that ﬁrst exceed a speciﬁed concentration, forcing or global warming level, and then return to or below that level again before the end of a speciﬁed period of time (e.g., before 2100). Sometimes the magnitude and likelihood of the overshoot are also characterised.",

See also: Afforestation, Anthropogenic removals, Carbon dioxide removal (CDR), Deforestation, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). [Note: For a discussion of the term forest and related terms such as afforestation, reforestation and deforestation, see the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and their 2019 Reﬁnement, and information provided by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] Residual risk The risk related to climate change impacts that remains following adaptation and mitigation efforts. Adaptation actions can redistribute risk and impacts, with increased risk and impacts in some areas or populations, and decreased risk and impacts in others. See also: Loss and Damage, losses and damages. Resilience The capacity of interconnected social, economic and ecological systems to cope with a hazardous event, trend or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure. Resilience is a positive attribute when it maintains capacity for adaptation, learning and/or transformation. See also: Hazard, Risk, Vulnerability. Restoration In the environmental context, restoration involves human interventions to assist the recovery of an ecosystem that has been previously degraded, damaged or destroyed. Risk The potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, recognising the diversity of values and objectives associated with such systems. In the context of climate change, risks can arise from potential impacts of climate change as well as human responses to climate change. Relevant adverse consequences include those on lives, livelihoods, health and well-being, economic, social and cultural assets and investments, infrastructure, services (including ecosystem services), ecosystems and species. In the context of climate change impacts, risks result from dynamic interactions between climate-related hazards with the exposure and vulnerability of the affected human or ecological system to the hazards. Hazards, exposure and vulnerability may each be subject to uncertainty in terms of magnitude and likelihood of occurrence, and each may change over time and space due to socio-economic changes and human decision-making. In the context of climate change responses, risks result from the potential for such responses not achieving the intended objective(s), or from potential trade-offs with, or negative side-effects on, other societal objectives, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Risks can arise for example from uncertainty in the implementation, effectiveness or outcomes of climate policy, climate-related investments, technology development or adoption, and system transitions. See also: Hazard, Exposure, Vulnerability, Impacts, Risk management, Adaptation, Mitigation. Key risk Key risks have potentially severe adverse consequences for humans and social-ecological systems resulting from the interaction of climate related hazards with vulnerabilities of societies and systems exposed. Scenario A plausible description of how the future may develop based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about key driving forces (e.g., rate of technological change, prices) and relationships. Note that scenarios are neither predictions nor forecasts but are used to provide a view of the implications of developments and actions. See also: Scenario, Scenario storyline. Emission scenario A plausible representation of the future",

    "text": "129 Glossary Annexes Small Island Developing States (SIDS) Small Island Developing States (SIDS), as recognised by the United Nations OHRLLS (UN Ofﬁce of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States), are a distinct group of developing countries facing specific social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities. They were recognised as a special case both for their environment and development at the Rio Earth Summit in Brazil in 1992. Fifty-eight countries and territories are presently classiﬁed as SIDS by the UN OHRLLS, with 38 being UN member states and 20 being Non-UN Members or Associate Members of the Regional Commissions. Social justice See: Justice. Social protection In the context of development aid and climate policy, social protection usually describes public and private initiatives that provide income or consumption transfers to the poor, protect the vulnerable against livelihood risks, and enhance the social status and rights of the marginalized, with the overall objective of reducing the economic and social vulnerability of poor, vulnerable, and marginalized groups. In other contexts, social protection may be used synonymously with social policy and can be described as all public and private initiatives that provide access to services, such as health, education, or housing, or income and consumption transfers to people. Social protection policies protect the poor and vulnerable against livelihood risks and enhance the social status and rights of the marginalized, as well as prevent vulnerable people from falling into poverty. Solar radiation modiﬁcation (SRM) Refers to a range of radiation modiﬁcation measures not related to greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation that seek to limit global warming. Most methods involve reducing the amount of incoming solar radiation reaching the surface, but others also act on the longwave radiation budget by reducing optical thickness and cloud lifetime. Source Any process or activity which releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. See also: Pool - carbon and nitrogen, Reservoir, Sequestration, Sequestration potential, Sink, Uptake. Stranded assets Assets exposed to devaluations or conversion to ‘liabilities’ because of unanticipated changes in their initially expected revenues due to innovations and/or evolutions of the business context, including changes in public regulations at the domestic and international levels. Sustainable development (SD) Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs and balances social, economic and environmental concerns. See also: Development pathways, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) The 17 Global Goals for development for all countries established by the United Nations through a participatory process and elaborated in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including ending poverty and hunger; ensuring health and well-being, education, gender equality, clean water and energy, and decent work; building and ensuring resilient and sustainable infrastructure, cities and consumption; reducing inequalities; protecting land and water ecosystems; promoting peace, justice and partnerships; and taking urgent action on climate change.

Lastly, just transitions may embody the \nredressing of past harms and perceived injustices. \n \nUrban \nThe categorisation of areas as “urban” by government statistical \ndepartments is generally based either on population size, population \ndensity, economic base, provision of services, or some combination \nof the above. Urban systems are networks and nodes of intensive \ninteraction and exchange including capital, culture, and material \nobjects. Urban areas exist on a continuum with rural areas and tend to \nexhibit higher levels of complexity, higher populations and population \ndensity, intensity of capital investment, and a preponderance of \nsecondary (processing) and tertiary (service) sector industries. The \nextent and intensity of these features varies signiﬁcantly within and \nbetween urban areas. Urban places and systems are open, with much \nmovement and exchange between more rural areas as well as other \nurban regions. Urban areas can be globally interconnected, facilitating \nrapid ﬂows between them, of capital investment, of ideas and culture, human \nmigration, and disease. See also: Cities, City region, Peri-urban areas, \nUrban Systems, Urbanisation.\n \nUrbanisation \nUrbanisation is a multi-dimensional process that involves at least \nthree simultaneous changes: 1) land use change: transformation of \nformerly rural settlements or natural land into urban settlements; \n2) demographic change: a shift in the spatial distribution of a population \nfrom rural to urban areas; and 3) infrastructure change: an increase in \nprovision of infrastructure services including electricity, sanitation, etc. \nUrbanisation often includes changes in lifestyle, culture, and behaviour, \nand thus alters the demographic, economic, and social structure of both \nurban and rural areas. See also: Settlement, Urban, Urban Systems.\n \nVector-borne disease \nIllnesses caused by parasites, viruses and bacteria that are transmitted \nby various vectors (e.g. mosquitoes, sandﬂies, triatomine bugs, blackﬂies, \nticks, tsetse ﬂies, mites, snails and lice). \n \nVulnerability \nThe propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability \nencompasses a variety of concepts and elements including sensitivity or \nsusceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt. See also: \nHazard, Exposure, Impacts, Risk.\n  \nWater security \nThe capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate \nquantities of acceptable-quality water for sustaining livelihoods, human \nwell-being and socio-economic development, for ensuring protection \nagainst water-borne pollution and water-related disasters and for \npreserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability. \n \nWell-being \nA state of existence that fulﬁlls various human needs, including \nmaterial living conditions and quality of life, as well as the ability \nto pursue one’s goals, to thrive and to feel satisﬁed with one’s life. \nEcosystem well-being refers to the ability of ecosystems to maintain \ntheir diversity and quality.",
